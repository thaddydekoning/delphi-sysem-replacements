# delphi-sysem-replacements

This repository contains Delphi system replacement sourcecode and binaries for several Delphi versions.
They are based on the KYLIX soursecode.
Note these binaries are compiled with the GPL flag set to comply with the original Delphi licensing.
That means inevitably that if you use them your application is GPL'd so you should include the GPL license.

The system replacements make your Delphi KOL applications even smaller.
There is no system replacement for FreePascal.
